# Monitoring-Virtual-Classroom-In-E-learning-Environment-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
More students today are taking online courses, but due to a lack of engagement, many feel that the quality of online courses is not as good as face to-face classes. This project uses Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to create a complete monitoring system for e-learning applications. The system identifies students through YOLOv8 for person detection and uses MediaPipe for face analysis to study facial expressions. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model classifies students' behavior into two categories: 'focused' and 'distracted' Manifestations of distracted behavior include multitasking, using other devices, and mind-wandering. Our proposed solution achieves 94% accuracy in real time facial expression detection, enabling teachers to improve teaching methods while maintaining discipline in the classroom.
